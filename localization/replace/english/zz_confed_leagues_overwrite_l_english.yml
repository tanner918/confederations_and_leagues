 confederation_elective_succession_law: "Federation Elective"
 confederation_elective_candidates_tooltip: "In order to be a valid Candidate under [federation|E] Elective, a character must fulfill one of the following conditions:\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Be a legitimate [close_family|E] member of the current ruler\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$Be a [vassal|E]\n#weak C&L Note: Due to the way the election inheritance laws are handled, if a vassal were to inherit the title with this succession law, they will have their government forcefully changed to whatever government the previous holder had. So, for example, if the holder of the title is Feudal, and their title heir is Clan, that Clan heir, when they inherit this title, will become Feudal. Until I figure out how to get around this, landed candidates must have the same government as the current holder."
 confederation_elective_succession_law_effects: "The [ruler|E] and all direct [vassals|E] can nominate a [title_heir|E] from among themselves and the [close_family|E] of the ruler.
